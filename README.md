### Overview

This repository hosts the *Degrammaticalization Database*, an open-access resource designed to support cross-linguistic research on cases where linguistic elements shift from more grammatical to less grammatical or more lexical forms. The database collects and systematizes attested instances of degrammaticalization reported in existing literature, encoding them through a parameter-based tagging system for ease of comparison and analysis.

### Purpose

The database aims to:

* Provide a **comprehensive collection** of degrammaticalization cases.
* Enable **comparative analysis** by tagging cases with consistent parameters (source/target form, meaning, host, language, type, and process).
* Support **typological research** by offering a structured, extensible resource for scholars in grammaticalization, degrammaticalization, and historical linguistics.

### Structure

The core data is organized in a CSV file with the following column-clusters:

* `Source` (form, meaning, host, language, type)
* `Target` (form, meaning, host, language, type)
* `Process` (a minimal, descriptive tag for the structural change)
* `Metadata` (citations, critical discussions, primary sources, and notes)

### How to Use

Researchers can:

* Explore the data directly for typological patterns.
* Filter and sort cases by specific parameters (e.g., type of source/target, language, process).
* Contribute by suggesting additional cases, corrections, or refinements.

### Methodological Notes

* The database relies on **existing literature** for all cases, without independent field verification.
* **Tagging decisions** (e.g., "clitic" vs. "function word") follow the original authors' classifications where possible, acknowledging the variability across linguistic traditions.
* Definitions and glosses for forms and meanings are primarily drawn from the cited literature or reputable lexicographic resources (e.g., Wiktionary).
